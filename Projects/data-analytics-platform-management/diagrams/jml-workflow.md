# Analytics Platform JML Workflow

## Purpose

This workflow shows the joiner, mover, and leaver process used to manage access across data analytics platforms such as Qlik and Tableau.

The aim is to make user access administration consistent, repeatable, and easier to evidence without exposing confidential platform or user information.
